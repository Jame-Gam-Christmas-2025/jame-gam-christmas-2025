# Jame Gam Christmas 2025 (to replace with game name)

## Getting Started
### Requirements

This game runs with Unity (6000.3.1f1)

### Guidelines (Git)

**Warning** Be sure to work on scoped systems and scenes to not erase others work

We are using a simplified version of Git Flow (a branching model)
with three kinds of branch :

- main (this is the final version of the game, we build the game from here).
- dev (created from main branch, this is the branch were we merge all our developments and do all the quality assurance of it).
- feature/your-feature-name (created from dev branch, this is your personal branch were you can work on a specific feature).
